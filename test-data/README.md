### Test data
- Currently the folder contains data from four teams.
- Each data file contains a distance matrix of different versions of texts and pseduo time stamps at five-minute intevals.
- Text distance is measured by one minus Jaccard similarity score. The distance score ranges between 0 to 1, with larger numbers representing higher lexical differences in the two texts.
